# TODO consider that it is cron the one that will be executing this hook script most of the time, so a method to warn a user when he returns to the screen session should be found or even better, to apply the changes immediately for him in all opened screen windows. Possible options:
# - Something like the MOTD could be evaluated if it is not global for the whole server.
# - Something that allows to execute a command on reattaching to the screen sessions or when switching screen sessions.
# - Something that allows to trigger an alert for all connected screen windows (e.g. message broadcasting?) so the connected users can get to know immediately that cron has pulled new changes.
# Now, for the implementation, one option might be to set an environment variable with the current jaime-hablutzel-linux-profile version/timestamp and then execute a command to compare this environment variable against the version of the latest pulled one.
