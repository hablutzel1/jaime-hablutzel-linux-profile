# TODOS #

* Make this repository private while keeping it comfortable to use it from any place, even from third party infrastructure.
* Explore other alternatives to share these files (and keep them updated) across Linux servers, e.g. Puppet, Chef, etc. 
* Try to automate the installation (or at least clearly warn about the absence) of dependencies, e.g. 'screen', 'crontab', etc.
* Try to automate the installation of all the other tools that I use in a regular basis, e.g.
  * emacs-nox
